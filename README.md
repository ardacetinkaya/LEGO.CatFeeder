# LEGO.CatFeeder
**LEGO.CatFeeder** is a simple project to feed your pets when you are away from your home and pet. A kind of mighty IoT device... 😜😜😜😜😜😜

Because of I am a #afol (Adult Fan Of LEGO) , I just created a simple feeder unit with LEGO for my cats.  And as you noticed, I am a software developer who loves to learn new things, so this simple but fun project is born in a day… 

The LEGO unit consist of **Raspberry Pi 3**, **BrickPi** and **LEGO Mindstorms**’ motor and **Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2.1**

The LEGO unit is just a combination of simple bricks, which is designed by myself, a mighty LEGO artist. 😜😜

# Code…
The OS of LEGO.CatFeeder is Raspbian. The code is just all Python for now… But there is also going to be some ASP.NET Core web application to monitor the device and keep some additional info. I haven’t decide yet… So why ASP.NET Core? Because ASP.NET Core can run on Linux and it rocks… 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻😜

And because it is a might IoT device, it has  some features with Azure IoT Hub. Yes, yes, this device is an Azure IoT Hub device; which means, it can send and receive some messages to other registered Azure IoT Hub devices.  Azure IoT Hub’s Python SDK have some problems but it works well with some additional effort. Just check GitHub issues for Azure IoT Hub… [Issues · Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python · GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/issues)

This is just a fun project that I do in my free times. My main purpose is to share some ideas and ‘how-to’ guides for #RaspberryPi, #ASPNETCore, #Azure and of course #LEGO.  There is going to be more fun at some time… 

And if you have any questions, ideas or problems about these, let me know… And also just share it on GitHub.
